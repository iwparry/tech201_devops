DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. This allows organizations to improve products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure processes.

## What are the benefits of DevOps?
### Speed
By moving at high velocity businesses can innovate for the customer faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results.
### Rapid Delivery
Increase the frequency and pace of releases, so you can improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix errors, the faster you can respond to your customers' needs and build a competitive advantage.
### Reliability
Ensue the quality of application updates, so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for the customer.
### Improved collaboration
Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model. Developers and operations teams collaborate closely and share many responsibilities. Teams are no longer 'siloed' and working together is made a high priority!
